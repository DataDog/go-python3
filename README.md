# go-python3

**Currently supports python-3.7 only.**

Golang bindings for the C-API of CPython-3.

This package provides a ``go`` package named "python" under which most of the
``PyXYZ`` functions and macros of the public C-API of CPython have been
exposed. Theoretically, you should be able use https://docs.python.org/3/c-api
and know what to type in your ``go`` program.


This project was inspired by https://github.com/sbinet/go-python. Go and take a look if we need something for python-2.7!

# Install

## Deps

We will need `pkg-config` and a working `python3.7` environment to build these
bindings. Make sure you have Python libraries and header files installed as
well (`python3.7-dev` on Debian or `python3-devel` on Centos for example)..

By default `pkg-config` will look at the `python3` library so if you want to
choose a specific version just symlink `python-X.Y.pc` to `python3.pc` or use
the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

## Go get

Then simply `go get github.com/DataDog/go-python3`

# API

Some functions mix go code and call to Python function. Those functions will
return and `int` and `error` type. The `int` represent the Python result code
and the `error` represent any issue from the Go layer.

Example:

`func PyRun_AnyFile(filename string)` open `filename` and then call CPython API
function `int PyRun_AnyFile(FILE *fp, const char *filename)`.

Therefore its signature is `func PyRun_AnyFile(filename string) (int, error)`,
the `int` represent the error code from the CPython `PyRun_AnyFile` function
and error will be set if we failed to open `filename`.

If an error is raise before calling th CPython function `int` default to `-1`.
